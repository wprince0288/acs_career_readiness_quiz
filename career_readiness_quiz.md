    - Brandon â€“ Hello!

Iâ€™ve been following Lockheed  for a while now and came across your LinkedIn profile when I was doing some research. I noticed you came from a non-traditional tech background. Iâ€™m currently in the full stack web development program at BloomTech and am interested in hearing a bit about your journey into the tech industry.

Right now Iâ€™m just looking for advice on how to stand out in the market and how to best utilize my bootcamp certificate and experience. Would love to ask you some questions about your experience at Lockheed and how you set yourself apart in your job search.

Would you be willing to connect for a 20-minute call so I could ask you a few questions? Please feel free to grab a time that works for you on my Calendly: https://calendly.com/app/personal/profile 

I look forward to speaking with you soon!
Brandon
